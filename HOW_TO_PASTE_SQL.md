# How to Paste SQL in Supabase Dashboard

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Wait for the SQL Editor to Load**
   - The "Loading..." message should disappear
   - You should see a text editor area appear

2. **Click in the Text Editor Area**
   - There should be a large text input box/editor
   - It might say "Type your query here" or be blank
   - Click inside this area to focus it

3. **Paste the SQL**
   - Press `Cmd+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+V` (Windows/Linux)
   - Or right-click and select "Paste"
   - The entire migration SQL should appear in the editor

4. **Click "Run" Button**
   - The green "Run" button at the bottom right
   - Or press `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows)

## If You Don't See a Text Editor:

1. **Try clicking "New query"** button (usually at the top)
2. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes the editor needs to reload
3. **Check if there's a "+" button** to create a new query

## Alternative: Use the SQL Editor Directly

If the visual editor isn't working, you can also:
- Type directly into the editor area
- The editor supports full SQL syntax
- It should have syntax highlighting

## What You Should See:

After pasting, you should see:
- The SQL code displayed in the editor
- Syntax highlighting (keywords in different colors)
- Line numbers on the left
- A "Run" button ready to execute

**Note**: The SQL Editor is a text-based editor, not a file upload interface. Just paste the SQL code directly into the text area.
